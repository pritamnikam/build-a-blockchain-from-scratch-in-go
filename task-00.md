# Task 0: Get Started
A blockchain is a distributed ledger that consists of a chain of blocks linked together. They provide benefits such as decentralization, transparency, and enhanced security through cryptographic algorithms.

A block is a fundamental blockchain unit that contains a single or a set of transactions or digital records. Each block contains a unique hash generated from its data and the previous block’s hash, forming an immutable chain.

A brief overview of the files and folders present in the /usercode/blockChainScratch/ directory is as follows:

The /usercode/blockChainScratch/blockchain/block.go file will contain the logic for creating and managing blocks of a blockchain.

The /usercode/blockChainScratch/blockchain/blockchain.go file will contain the logic for implementing the blockchain.

The /usercode/blockChainScratch/blockchain/proof.go file will contain the logic for the proof of work (PoW) algorithm.

The /usercode/blockChainScratch/blockchain/wallet.go file will contain the logic for managing user wallets.

The /usercode/blockChainScratch/main.go file will contain the code for testing the blockchain.
